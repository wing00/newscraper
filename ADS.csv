But now they are preparing to go after Puzder by pointing to his comments about women and the racy Carl's Jr. ads he's defended, a Senate Democratic aide told CNN on Wednesday.The aide said Democrats hope the line of questioning will draw attention to Puzder's character, while also putting Republicans on the spot.Puzder has frequently defended Carl's Jr. ads featuring bikini-clad models, calling them the core of the restaurant's philosophy, and has said he avoids the sets of those ad shoots because he is ""happily married and would like to stay that way.""When Carl's Jr. released an ad proclaiming it believed in ""putting hot models in our commercials because ugly ones don't sell burgers,"" Puzder called the ad ""the core of what we believe.""""It is not a reinvention of the brands; instead, it is an evolution that refines the core of what we believe,"" Puzder said in a 2011 press release announcing the company's ad, ""Anthem.""And in 2013, he said he avoids the sets of Carl's Jr. ads featuring bikini clad models, saying he has a ""very good marriage"" and wants to ""keep it preserved.""""It certainly raises questions for Democrats that the nominee for Department of Labor would not only advocate for harmful stereotypes about women, but go so far as to say they are at the core of his company's values?"" the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the Democrats' strategy, said. ""And given the role that the secretary of labor plays in standing up for women's rights at work, Republicans should be concerned as well.""The Trump transition did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Democrats may also seek to tie Puzder's comments to President-elect Donald Trump's numerous controversial and sexually aggressive comments about women. A Democratic aide said Democrats are eager to see how Republicans react to Puzder's past comments given their criticism of Trump's comments.A half-dozen Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions forcefully criticized Trump over the comments recorded by a hot mic in 2005.But Trump's comments -- in which he bragged about being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity status -- went much further than anything Puzder has said publicly. Other comments from Trump, including those on Howard Stern's radio show where he rated women on a scale of 1 to 10 and talked about sexual acts he's engaged in, did not draw similar outrage from most Republicans.And even still, only one Republican currently sitting on the committee, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she would not vote for Trump after the 2005 tape surfaced.Others, including Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and even the committee's chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander called Trump's comments everything from ""unacceptable"" to ""disgusting,"" but did not pull their support of the Republican nominee.",2017-01-05T02:34:00,

Below are some of the highlights from Bing Ads as we continue to incorporate user feedback into the platform for success into 2017 and beyond, along with some trends we’ve seen on the most competitive and expensive categories of keywords in 2016.
What was new and noteworthy in 2016
Each year, Bing Ads releases hundreds of feature enhancements and new features. It can be difficult to keep up with all the betas, updates and feature releases, so let me highlight a few releases that I was the most excited about in 2016 that you’ll want to make sure you didn’t miss.
Editor for Mac
We heard you! After much input and anticipation, Bing Ads Editor for Mac beta arrived in June to delight users with high speed and ease of use. Users raved about the impact on their work; it saves them hours each day. Just like Bing Ads Editor 11, it included bulk edits, managing multiple accounts at the same time and copy/pasting across multiple accounts.
Bing Shopping Campaigns in Editor
We also heard your feedback that managing Bing Shopping Campaigns directly from the UI is not super-easy. In September, we released Bing Shopping Campaigns integration into Bing Ads Editor, allowing you to efficiently and easily manage shopping campaigns.
Shared Budgets
Users expressed their pain with manually updating individual campaign budgets, which often resulted in underutilized budgets. In October, we delivered Shared Budgets, which automatically distributes a single daily budget across all campaigns or a subgroup of campaigns opted into the shared budget. Users can now enjoy smarter, streamlined budgeting without the hassle of constant juggling and recalculating.
Expanded Text Ads
In an effort to standardize ad formats to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet and desktop devices, we launched an Expanded Text Ads pilot in August. Titles jumped from 25 to 60 characters, while descriptions increased from 71 to 80. This extra space gives users a way to create more compelling calls to action and drive higher conversions.
Broad Match Modifier opportunities
We’ve heard our users express interest in expanding their reach and getting more volume. Broad Match Modifier (BMM) is our exclusive, innovative answer that delivers relevant, high-quality traffic with more precision than broad match alone. It leverages marketplace intelligence to suggest the most optimal BMM keywords for your campaign. Users can find three easy steps on the Opportunities page.
Moments in search
Looking back at 2016, there were moments that captured the spotlight of the world, including the US election, the summer Olympics and the viral sensation Pokémon Go. Discover some of the trends in search that are highlighted by Bing’s key moments in 2016 that you might have missed.
In paid search, one of the trends we saw in Bing Ads was a shift in the most competitive keyword auctions moving from the legal field to rehabilitation and treatment centers.
I know that keyword CPCs can vary a lot based on position and the different modifiers that advertisers place on the keyword. I analyzed our internal Bing Ads data on bidded keywords that received at least 100 clicks during 2016 to remove the one-off instances and outliers of both incredibly high and low CPCs. For instance, one of the most expensive clicks in 2016 was for “houston texas personal injury lawyer” at $167.78.
Then I categorized the keywords by vertical to see what the most competitive keyword auctions are within Bing Ads and what the average CPC was to get into the top spot.
Here is what I found: The most competitive and expensive CPCs are in lucrative industries like health care, education, insurance, legal and financial services.
These industries tend to evaluate customers by lifetime value, not just the value of the revenue from a single transaction or lead generated. The long-term customer value model makes the higher CPCs worthwhile — for example, an online masters degree can cost between $30,000 and $120,000, depending on the school and the program; a drug rehabilitation program can cost upwards of $10,000 per stay; and the legal profession can have billing rates that reach $250/hour. With this in mind, the average ~$40 CPC doesn’t seem as crazy as if you were a retailer whose average order value ranges between $50 and $100.
The most competitive 100 keywords were also spread across the verticals, with 29 percent being in the Education vertical, 27 percent in the Legal vertical, 17 percent in Financial Services and 16 percent in the Health and Medical verticals. What you can’t see reflected in the charts and the graph is the depth of the tail represented in the keywords across each of the verticals.
For example, in the Education vertical, the queries were spread across many different types of degrees and programs, from accounting to construction management. Many of the queries within the Legal vertical included keywords that included specific cities along with variations of lawyer, lawyers, attorney and attorneys. When we look at the spectrum of queries, we can see that the tail is diversifying and that every day there are new queries that we have never seen before.
So what does this mean if you are an advertiser in one of the higher-CPC verticals? If you want to acquire new customers, search is still a great tool for you to do so. Just make sure that you do your research before you get started so you can refine your search campaigns to reach your target market. In my mind, it also goes back to paid search basics and best practices.
So what are the trends in 2016 that surprised you?

The ads, released Wednesday by Allied Progress, urge Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) to oppose the nomination of the multimillionaire hedge funder and former Goldman Sachs executive.
The ads highlight Mnuchin’s record as co-owner of OneWest, a bank that profited during the height of the 2008 financial crisis by engaging in an array of unethical practices. Regulators say the bank gave predatory loans to the elderly and aggressively foreclosed on people’s homes. One of those people included a 90-year-old woman who was evicted over 27 cents. The bank was also accused of racist lending practices like redlining against minority groups.
“Mnuchin made millions after his bank foreclosed on homeowners,” the narrator says in the ads. (Liberal billionaire donor George Soros, along with fellow hedge fund manager John Paulson, who is now a Trump supporter, were part of the investment team that purchased the failing bank.)
The 30-second spots, which are backed by a six-figure cable and broadcast buy, begin airing this week in Arizona and Nevada ― two states hit particularly hard by foreclosures during the recession.
“This is a guy who is a predator when it comes to making money. He say an opportunity to profit off the backs of hardworking Americans by taking their homes and he ran with it and he did it,” Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.
“To put a finer point on it: The foreclosure crisis did not just hurt people whose homes were taken,” he added. “It devastated communities, driving real estate values into the tank and it may not be the case for Steven Mnuchin or Donald Trump, but for most Americans the family home is the single largest investment and something that most people rely on in retirement. Profound, long-lasting and devastating impact, not just on people whose homes were taken.”
Democrats received more ammo in the fight against Mnuchin’s nomination earlier this week, after The Intercept reported OneWest had engaged in other shady practices. The bank was accused of “widespread misconduct” and there is evidence that it allegedly violated “notice and waiting period statutes, illegally backdated key documents, and effectively gamed foreclosure auctions,” according to a leaked 2013 memo from the California attorney general’s office.
“Steven Mnuchin got over 100,000 homeowners loan modifications and reduced thousands of loan balances,” Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Mnuchin, told HuffPost. The bank foreclosed on 35,000 homes in California alone, according to the memo published in The Intercept. “OneWest is an American success story,” Bradshaw said, “and Steven looks forward to telling it at his hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.”
Mnuchin is one of several wealthy Goldman Sachs alums Trump has named to his Cabinet ― despite his populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric during the campaign. Last month, the president-elect named Gary Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, to head the National Economic Council. And on Wednesday, Trump nominated Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s about one third of the company’s employees.
In a blog post shared on Wednesday, Williams said he wants to move away from ad-supported content, which is how most stuff on the internet generates revenue. Williams described that business model, which is almost entirely dependent on clicks and views, as a “broken system.”
“The vast majority of articles, videos, and other ‘content’ we all consume on a daily basis is paid for  —  directly or indirectly —  by corporations who are funding it in order to advance their goals,” Williams wrote. “And it is measured, amplified, and rewarded based on its ability to do that. Period. As a result, we get … well, what we get. And it’s getting worse.”
So if ad-supported content is no good, what will Medium do instead? Williams hasn’t decided.
“We are shifting our resources and attention to defining a new model for writers and creators to be rewarded, based on the value they’re creating for people,” he wrote. “It is too soon to say exactly what this will look like.”
Medium simply grew too quickly, according to a person close to the company, and laying off 50 people is part of Medium’s plan to cut costs while it figures out what comes next.
Medium has raised more than $130 million from a number of well-known investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Greylock and Spark Capital. Its most recent funding round, back in April, valued the company at more than $600 million.",2017-01-04T21:15:00,

One of the best ways a business can make use of the photo-sharing platform is to invest in Instagram ads. Advertisers of all sizes are seeing fantastic results. From driving mass awareness, to increasing website sales and mobile app downloads, Instagram offers limitless possibilities for the creative marketer.

Why advertise on Instagram?
Instagram ads have proven to be an effective means for generating new business. A report from market research firm eMarketer predicts that nearly three quarters of American companies with 100 employees or more will turn to the photo-sharing app for marketing purposes in 2017—up from a little more than half this year, reports Mashable.
Instagram offers several compelling case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of their ad features.
They measure each campaign’s success based on metrics such as reach, ad recall, and awareness, instead of likes, comments, and follower counts over the span of the campaign.
For example, monthly book subscription service Read Dog Books used Instagram Stories to connect with its audience while running a single ad campaign on Instagram and Facebook to encourage people to subscribe. The result? A seven times return on ad spend.
A study conducted by Forrester in 2016 reviewed how the top 50 global brands market on social media. Forrester evaluated 11.8 million user interactions on 2,489 posts made by 249 branded profiles. Data was collected on how many top brands use each social network, how many fans they have, how often they post, and how often users interact with their posts. Forrester found that the average number of Instagram followers for a top brand is now over 1 million—almost five times higher than in 2015.
Instagram users aren’t just following their friends and celebrities anymore. They are following their favorite brands too. Could that be you?
Types of Instagram ads
There are three main types of Instagram ads to choose from. Whether your goal is to build brand awareness, get more website visits, or increase downloads of your mobile app, Instagram can help you access a huge, engaged audience. Read on for a rundown of photo, video, and carousel ads, and then watch the video below to determine which is the best option for your business.
Instagram photo ads
With photo ads, businesses can tell their story and feature products through visually engaging imagery. Market your brand to a broad audience or just the customers in your hometown with guaranteed impressions.
For example, Brazilian paint brand, Suvinil launched an Instagram ads campaign focused on a specific target audience—people over 35. With the help of Instagram’s segmentation tools, Suvinil targeted people who might be interested in buying their paint. People who announced moving, or had recently changed their relationship status, as well as people who had interests in pregnancy and decor.
In just 2 months, the campaign achieved a 15-point increase in ad recall on Instagram.
Instagram video ads
You can make Instagram video ads up to 60 seconds long, but according to data from Wista, the first 30 seconds of a social video is what matters most. If you can hook your audience in that timeframe, they are more likely to stick around and engage.
Many brands have had great success with Instagram video ads. Creative app company Lightricks used beautiful Instagram videos to help them hit the top of the download charts with their new app Enlight.
The direct-response video ads were a huge hit, boosting Lightricks’ conversion rate by 50 percent compared to non-Instagram campaigns. They achieved enormous reach and a lower cost per install, while racking up 40 million post engagements along the way. In the end, Enlight secured more than 300,000 downloads and hit the number one spot in the global iOS paid app charts.
Instagram carousel ads
With carousel ads, Instagram users can swipe to see additional images and a call to action button takes them to a website to learn more. Carousel ads are like the digital version of the multi-page print campaigns of yesteryear. Unlike print ads, carousel ads offer the added benefit of taking people to a website to learn more.
For example, a new restaurant could showcase how multiple ingredients come together to make a delicious meal. Once their appetite is whet, you can have a button that directs them to the reservations page of your website.
Running race organizer Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series wanted to encourage people to sign up for one of its events, so it created targeted carousel ads on Instagram to promote its one-day sale.
The team first targeted people who had registered for a past event, and then generated a new audience based on those runners’ friends and people who shared their interests. The company ran a teaser video ad in the two days leading up to the single-day Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon sale. The video boosted awareness of the race series and alerted people to the upcoming sale.
The race company then targeted carousel link ads to those people who interacted with the video. The ad featured runners holding signs announcing the lowest prices of the year, while a series of calls to action invited people to sign up.
The Rock ‘n’ Roll team succeeded with its Instagram ad winter sale promo, achieving a 24 time return on ad spend and a 52 percent increase in registrations, year-over-year.
Call-to-action buttons
In late 2015 Instagram added several new features to its advertising platform, including call-to-action buttons such as Shop Now and Install Now. The Call to Action (CTA) button is designed to bring a business’ most important objective to the front lines of its Instagram presence. Call to action buttons link to any destination on or off Instagram that aligns with a business’s goals.

How to advertise on Instagram
To run ads on Instagram you’ll first need a Facebook page. Facebook now owns Instagram and the two platforms work in conjunction. Pages are for brands, organizations, and public figures.
Like Facebook profiles, Pages can be customized with stories, events and more. People who like a Page can get updates in News Feed. Learn more about setting up a Facebook page for your business with Hootsuite’s Facebook Marketing: The Complete Guide. Once you have that process down, you can get started with Instagram ads.
First, sign up for Business Manager
Go to business.facebook.com.
Click Create Account.
Enter a name for your business, select the primary Page, and enter your name and work email address. If you don’t yet have a Page for your business.
Move through the rest of the on-boarding flow by entering the rest of the required fields.
Learn how to add people to Business Manager.
Once you have Business Manager setup, you can add your Instagram account
Go to your Business Manager.
On the left side of the page, click Business Settings then Instagram Accounts.
Click Claim New Instagram Account.
Add your username and password, then click Next.
To authorize one or more of your ad accounts to use the Instagram account, check the box next to each ad account and click Save Changes.
Whoo! That was a lot of steps. Now you are ready to create your Instagram ad.
Go to ad creation.
Choose an objective from the list. Keep in mind that only the following objectives will allow you to create ads that will be eligible to appear on Instagram: Brand awareness, Reach, Traffic (for clicks to your website or to the app store for your app), App installs, Engagement (for post engagement only), Video views, and Conversions (for conversions on your website or app).
Note: Some of these objectives may look different when you create an ad. Learn more about the changes to objectives.
Next to Campaign Name, add a name for your campaign or use the default name that appears.
Now it’s time to choose the audience for your ad.
In the Audience section, create an audience for your ad. You can choose audience characteristics such as age, gender, interests, behaviors, ethnic affinity, location, and even politics. Learn about the targeting options available.
Like Facebook ads, Instagram ads offer options to pay per engagement or by impression (CPM). The average cost per click for an Instagram ad in Q3 2016 was $0.72. If your boss has given you a specific budget for your Instagram ad campaign, you can set it in the Budget and Schedule section, where you can choose a budget and set your ad’s schedule.
You can choose either a daily budget or a lifetime budget for your campaign. Choose wisely.
Daily budget sets your ad up to run continuously throughout the day, meaning that the algorithm will automatically pace your spending per day. With this option there is a minimum daily budget depending on different factors in your campaign.
Lifetime budget gives your ad a run for a specified length of time, meaning the algorithm paces your spending over the entire time period that you set for the campaign.
You can set your optimization and bid options manually. In the Optimize for Ad Delivery section, you’ll update how you want to optimize your ad. In the Bid Amount section, you can choose a manual bid.
Next to Ad Set Name, add a name for your ad set or use the default name that appears.
In the Format section, choose the type of media you’d like your ad to include. Review the technical and design recommendations to make sure your photos and videos are putting their best foot forward.

Instagram ads best practices
Know your audience
One of the most wonderful features of Instagram ads is the targeting capabilities. Rather than sending a photo of your business out into the ether, you can send it directly to people who might already be interested in what you have to offer.
Who might those customers be? Our handy guide to creating audience personas outlines the questions you need to ask yourself to determine who your customers are. How old are they? Where do they live? What sorts of jobs do they have? What do they do outside of work?
Check out the video below to learn more about targeting and optimizing your Instagram ads.

Captivate with captions
Images aren’t everything. The caption on your Instagram post provides an excellent opportunity to show off your brand’s personality. Your brand voice is part of you broader social media marketing plan. Start by asking yourself: what are the qualities and values I want my brand to promote? Make a list and use it to shape your image. You might also try brainstorming a few adjectives that describe your brand and use those to refine the voice.
For more, check out our guide to writing great Instagram captions.
Use hashtags
Instagram posts with at least one hashtag average 12.6 percent more engagement than those with no hashtags, according to a study by Simply Measured. So use them when they are relevant to your post and target audience—but don’t use so many that they crowd your copy and make it difficult to read. Learn more about hashtagging like a pro in The Complete Instagram Hashtag Guide for Business.
Be consistent
Using the same filter or style on your brand’s Instagram posts can give your feed a consistent look. Your audience will recognize you right away in their feed. Researchers found that 90 percent of immediate judgments made about a product can be based on color alone. Not only that but “the relationship between brands and color hinges on the perceived appropriateness of the color being used for the particular brand.”

His hockey wrist shot is better than yours.
This was a difficult shitlist to compile because 2016 produced a shitpile of shitty ads; the biggest, shittiest ad shitpile ever. Imagine a Tower of Babel made of shit, filled with a shit-ton of shit-talking marketing shitheads senselessly shouting out every window about their shit-awful ads, non-stop. That was The Year in Advertising, 2016.
Therefore, this just needed to be done. And here they are: The bottom 1o ads of 2016, from least worst to worst worst.
Advertisement
10. Am/Pm Organic Cafe, Nepal, “Flowchart”
I could go into the logic of this headache of a flowchart billboard (note that if you have a problem and can’t do anything about it, there is a line up to their logo, but no arrow), but I’d rather just take a 50 cal Gatling gun to it. Found on reddit.
9. Apartments.com, “Apartments Alert”
VIDEO
Remember Max Headroom? I liked him (although he was mistakenly used to try to save New Coke), and his name was creative. Brad Bellflower is not creative or funny or interesting or relevant or useful. I just want to punch his face through the back of his skull. Agency: RPA.
8. Ignite Instant Light Charcoal, “Fly”
From agency DDB South Africa’s press note: “Ignite…catches alight so fast that an insect sitting on one of the coals would be incinerated before it could fly away.” (This is a lie.)
How about 25 insects? And would my steak then have an aftertaste of burnt fly? Why not put a couple of cockroaches in the ad, too? Maybe a dung beetle.
7. American Express, “Tina Fey’s Guide To Workout Gear”
VIDEO
Maybe the most embarrassingly unfunny commercial of 2016. I hope Fey didn’t help with the writing. But the script isn’t what got this spot in the bottom 10. It’s how much shit she bought, how obnoxiously Amex shoves hyper-consumerism into our less-rich-than-Fey faces. Buy! Buy! BUY!
6. Mellow Mushroom Pizza Bakers, “Clinically Proven”
VIDEO
Parodying Erectile Dysfunction ads (badly) to sell pizza is a brilliant move, said nobody with or without penis, ever. Agency: BooneOakley, Charlotte.
5. Secret, “Raise”
VIDEO
“Feminine” brands pandering to millennial women mean well, buy they mostly don’t execute well. And this very uncomfortable spot portrays our hero as, well, a very stupid person. Here’s a more in-depth take on why the ad sucks from a smart millennial woman. Note: this whole Pandering Awkwardly To Young Women Femvertising Movement is Dove’s fault.
4. and 3. (tie) Pizza Hut “#PizzaBump” and Bergedorfer Beer, “Pregnant”
VIDEO
The spot, via Grip Limited, Toronto, is for Pizza Hut’s “Triple Treat Box.” And, see, these men have eaten so many pizzas that they got so fat that they look pregnant, but are not, but are probably close to death.
These ads, by Jung von Matt, Hamburg, are for Bergedorfer Beer. And, see, these alcoholics have drunk so much of the beer that they have massive beer guts that make them look pregnant. They are also close to death. And not pregnant.
The “pregnant male” is such a refreshing, original, game-changing, crackerjack of a creative linchpin, isn’t it?
2. Facebook “station takeover”
Image via: Instagram.
Facebook did this “takeover” execution in a few stations worldwide. Nothing dehumanizingly dystopian about this experience. Also, it’s not at all a scary metaphor for Facebook’s ultimate goal of taking over your life 100 percent, 24/7. The next step in this campaign is, you will see your own Facebook page updates on the walls/ceilings around you in every subway/train station in the world.
1. Chevy, “Stereotypes”
VIDEO
This list, of course, should be made up of 10 of these Chevy “Real People, Not Actors” ads. I just picked the worst one. (The “breakdancing millennials” spot they mock here would be a much better ad than this commercial.) I don’t care how many Chevrolets this campaign is selling, because it continues to make the world a markedly worse place.
And, it needs to be said, more than a few of the real people in these ads are actors. According to GM, they just don’t have their SAG cards yet. (I don’t believe that either.) But that’s not what makes the spots the shittiest ads of 2016. It’s the cringeworthy dialogue between the coached “people” and the astoundingly annoying and pathetically smarmy host, an actor named Potsch Boyd. Agency: Commonwealth/McCann, Detroit.

But now they are preparing to go after Puzder by pointing to his comments about women and the racy Carl's Jr. ads he's defended, a Senate Democratic aide told CNN on Wednesday.The aide said Democrats hope the line of questioning will draw attention to Puzder's character, while also putting Republicans on the spot.Puzder has frequently defended Carl's Jr. ads featuring bikini-clad models, calling them the core of the restaurant's philosophy, and has said he avoids the sets of those ad shoots because he is ""happily married and would like to stay that way.""When Carl's Jr. released an ad proclaiming it believed in ""putting hot models in our commercials because ugly ones don't sell burgers,"" Puzder called the ad ""the core of what we believe.""""It is not a reinvention of the brands; instead, it is an evolution that refines the core of what we believe,"" Puzder said in a 2011 press release announcing the company's ad, ""Anthem.""And in 2013, he said he avoids the sets of Carl's Jr. ads featuring bikini clad models, saying he has a ""very good marriage"" and wants to ""keep it preserved.""""It certainly raises questions for Democrats that the nominee for Department of Labor would not only advocate for harmful stereotypes about women, but go so far as to say they are at the core of his company's values?"" the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the Democrats' strategy, said. ""And given the role that the secretary of labor plays in standing up for women's rights at work, Republicans should be concerned as well.""The Trump transition did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Democrats may also seek to tie Puzder's comments to President-elect Donald Trump's numerous controversial and sexually aggressive comments about women. A Democratic aide said Democrats are eager to see how Republicans react to Puzder's past comments given their criticism of Trump's comments.A half-dozen Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions forcefully criticized Trump over the comments recorded by a hot mic in 2005.But Trump's comments -- in which he bragged about being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity status -- went much further than anything Puzder has said publicly. Other comments from Trump, including those on Howard Stern's radio show where he rated women on a scale of 1 to 10 and talked about sexual acts he's engaged in, did not draw similar outrage from most Republicans.And even still, only one Republican currently sitting on the committee, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she would not vote for Trump after the 2005 tape surfaced.Others, including Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and even the committee's chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander called Trump's comments everything from ""unacceptable"" to ""disgusting,"" but did not pull their support of the Republican nominee.",2017-01-05T02:34:00,

Below are some of the highlights from Bing Ads as we continue to incorporate user feedback into the platform for success into 2017 and beyond, along with some trends we’ve seen on the most competitive and expensive categories of keywords in 2016.
What was new and noteworthy in 2016
Each year, Bing Ads releases hundreds of feature enhancements and new features. It can be difficult to keep up with all the betas, updates and feature releases, so let me highlight a few releases that I was the most excited about in 2016 that you’ll want to make sure you didn’t miss.
Editor for Mac
We heard you! After much input and anticipation, Bing Ads Editor for Mac beta arrived in June to delight users with high speed and ease of use. Users raved about the impact on their work; it saves them hours each day. Just like Bing Ads Editor 11, it included bulk edits, managing multiple accounts at the same time and copy/pasting across multiple accounts.
Bing Shopping Campaigns in Editor
We also heard your feedback that managing Bing Shopping Campaigns directly from the UI is not super-easy. In September, we released Bing Shopping Campaigns integration into Bing Ads Editor, allowing you to efficiently and easily manage shopping campaigns.
Shared Budgets
Users expressed their pain with manually updating individual campaign budgets, which often resulted in underutilized budgets. In October, we delivered Shared Budgets, which automatically distributes a single daily budget across all campaigns or a subgroup of campaigns opted into the shared budget. Users can now enjoy smarter, streamlined budgeting without the hassle of constant juggling and recalculating.
Expanded Text Ads
In an effort to standardize ad formats to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet and desktop devices, we launched an Expanded Text Ads pilot in August. Titles jumped from 25 to 60 characters, while descriptions increased from 71 to 80. This extra space gives users a way to create more compelling calls to action and drive higher conversions.
Broad Match Modifier opportunities
We’ve heard our users express interest in expanding their reach and getting more volume. Broad Match Modifier (BMM) is our exclusive, innovative answer that delivers relevant, high-quality traffic with more precision than broad match alone. It leverages marketplace intelligence to suggest the most optimal BMM keywords for your campaign. Users can find three easy steps on the Opportunities page.
Moments in search
Looking back at 2016, there were moments that captured the spotlight of the world, including the US election, the summer Olympics and the viral sensation Pokémon Go. Discover some of the trends in search that are highlighted by Bing’s key moments in 2016 that you might have missed.
In paid search, one of the trends we saw in Bing Ads was a shift in the most competitive keyword auctions moving from the legal field to rehabilitation and treatment centers.
I know that keyword CPCs can vary a lot based on position and the different modifiers that advertisers place on the keyword. I analyzed our internal Bing Ads data on bidded keywords that received at least 100 clicks during 2016 to remove the one-off instances and outliers of both incredibly high and low CPCs. For instance, one of the most expensive clicks in 2016 was for “houston texas personal injury lawyer” at $167.78.
Then I categorized the keywords by vertical to see what the most competitive keyword auctions are within Bing Ads and what the average CPC was to get into the top spot.
Here is what I found: The most competitive and expensive CPCs are in lucrative industries like health care, education, insurance, legal and financial services.
These industries tend to evaluate customers by lifetime value, not just the value of the revenue from a single transaction or lead generated. The long-term customer value model makes the higher CPCs worthwhile — for example, an online masters degree can cost between $30,000 and $120,000, depending on the school and the program; a drug rehabilitation program can cost upwards of $10,000 per stay; and the legal profession can have billing rates that reach $250/hour. With this in mind, the average ~$40 CPC doesn’t seem as crazy as if you were a retailer whose average order value ranges between $50 and $100.
The most competitive 100 keywords were also spread across the verticals, with 29 percent being in the Education vertical, 27 percent in the Legal vertical, 17 percent in Financial Services and 16 percent in the Health and Medical verticals. What you can’t see reflected in the charts and the graph is the depth of the tail represented in the keywords across each of the verticals.
For example, in the Education vertical, the queries were spread across many different types of degrees and programs, from accounting to construction management. Many of the queries within the Legal vertical included keywords that included specific cities along with variations of lawyer, lawyers, attorney and attorneys. When we look at the spectrum of queries, we can see that the tail is diversifying and that every day there are new queries that we have never seen before.
So what does this mean if you are an advertiser in one of the higher-CPC verticals? If you want to acquire new customers, search is still a great tool for you to do so. Just make sure that you do your research before you get started so you can refine your search campaigns to reach your target market. In my mind, it also goes back to paid search basics and best practices.
So what are the trends in 2016 that surprised you?

The ads, released Wednesday by Allied Progress, urge Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) to oppose the nomination of the multimillionaire hedge funder and former Goldman Sachs executive.
The ads highlight Mnuchin’s record as co-owner of OneWest, a bank that profited during the height of the 2008 financial crisis by engaging in an array of unethical practices. Regulators say the bank gave predatory loans to the elderly and aggressively foreclosed on people’s homes. One of those people included a 90-year-old woman who was evicted over 27 cents. The bank was also accused of racist lending practices like redlining against minority groups.
“Mnuchin made millions after his bank foreclosed on homeowners,” the narrator says in the ads. (Liberal billionaire donor George Soros, along with fellow hedge fund manager John Paulson, who is now a Trump supporter, were part of the investment team that purchased the failing bank.)
The 30-second spots, which are backed by a six-figure cable and broadcast buy, begin airing this week in Arizona and Nevada ― two states hit particularly hard by foreclosures during the recession.
“This is a guy who is a predator when it comes to making money. He say an opportunity to profit off the backs of hardworking Americans by taking their homes and he ran with it and he did it,” Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.
“To put a finer point on it: The foreclosure crisis did not just hurt people whose homes were taken,” he added. “It devastated communities, driving real estate values into the tank and it may not be the case for Steven Mnuchin or Donald Trump, but for most Americans the family home is the single largest investment and something that most people rely on in retirement. Profound, long-lasting and devastating impact, not just on people whose homes were taken.”
Democrats received more ammo in the fight against Mnuchin’s nomination earlier this week, after The Intercept reported OneWest had engaged in other shady practices. The bank was accused of “widespread misconduct” and there is evidence that it allegedly violated “notice and waiting period statutes, illegally backdated key documents, and effectively gamed foreclosure auctions,” according to a leaked 2013 memo from the California attorney general’s office.
“Steven Mnuchin got over 100,000 homeowners loan modifications and reduced thousands of loan balances,” Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Mnuchin, told HuffPost. The bank foreclosed on 35,000 homes in California alone, according to the memo published in The Intercept. “OneWest is an American success story,” Bradshaw said, “and Steven looks forward to telling it at his hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.”
Mnuchin is one of several wealthy Goldman Sachs alums Trump has named to his Cabinet ― despite his populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric during the campaign. Last month, the president-elect named Gary Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, to head the National Economic Council. And on Wednesday, Trump nominated Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s about one third of the company’s employees.
In a blog post shared on Wednesday, Williams said he wants to move away from ad-supported content, which is how most stuff on the internet generates revenue. Williams described that business model, which is almost entirely dependent on clicks and views, as a “broken system.”
“The vast majority of articles, videos, and other ‘content’ we all consume on a daily basis is paid for  —  directly or indirectly —  by corporations who are funding it in order to advance their goals,” Williams wrote. “And it is measured, amplified, and rewarded based on its ability to do that. Period. As a result, we get … well, what we get. And it’s getting worse.”
So if ad-supported content is no good, what will Medium do instead? Williams hasn’t decided.
“We are shifting our resources and attention to defining a new model for writers and creators to be rewarded, based on the value they’re creating for people,” he wrote. “It is too soon to say exactly what this will look like.”
Medium simply grew too quickly, according to a person close to the company, and laying off 50 people is part of Medium’s plan to cut costs while it figures out what comes next.
Medium has raised more than $130 million from a number of well-known investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Greylock and Spark Capital. Its most recent funding round, back in April, valued the company at more than $600 million.",2017-01-04T21:15:00,

Raiders expected to start Connor Cook vs. Texans
Miami is going to be a significant underdog against the Steelers, a team they beat at full strength in the regular season. They don't have the secondary to hold up if the opposing quarterback can get to his second read, never mind the third.
After over 20 years of business, the break-up came in the wake of poor growth, with Sanofi Pasteur MSD only bringing in sales of €824m in 2015 - less than a fifth of Sanofi's year-end vaccines sales of €4.7bn. In August, an advisory group to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the vaccine in countries with high Dengue transmission.""[The advisory group's recommendations] further validate the scientific and medical value of Dengvaxia and send a clear message to endemic countries about the strong public health benefit to be gained by introducing the dengue vaccine in integrated disease management efforts to combat their dengue burden"", Sanofi's President of Global R&D Elias Zerhouni said in an April statement.",2017-01-05T06:23:00,

Companies who can harness the power of that platform to share what’s great about their business stand to grow their presence and profit among millennials considerably.
One of the best ways a business can make use of the photo-sharing platform is to invest in Instagram ads. Advertisers of all sizes are seeing fantastic results. From driving mass awareness, to increasing website sales and mobile app downloads, Instagram offers limitless possibilities for the creative marketer.

Why advertise on Instagram?
Instagram ads have proven to be an effective means for generating new business. A report from market research firm eMarketer predicts that nearly three quarters of American companies with 100 employees or more will turn to the photo-sharing app for marketing purposes in 2017—up from a little more than half this year, reports Mashable.
Instagram offers several compelling case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of their ad features.
They measure each campaign’s success based on metrics such as reach, ad recall, and awareness, instead of likes, comments, and follower counts over the span of the campaign.
For example, monthly book subscription service Read Dog Books used Instagram Stories to connect with its audience while running a single ad campaign on Instagram and Facebook to encourage people to subscribe. The result? A seven times return on ad spend.
A study conducted by Forrester in 2016 reviewed how the top 50 global brands market on social media. Forrester evaluated 11.8 million user interactions on 2,489 posts made by 249 branded profiles. Data was collected on how many top brands use each social network, how many fans they have, how often they post, and how often users interact with their posts. Forrester found that the average number of Instagram followers for a top brand is now over 1 million—almost five times higher than in 2015.
Instagram users aren’t just following their friends and celebrities anymore. They are following their favorite brands too. Could that be you?
Types of Instagram ads
There are three main types of Instagram ads to choose from. Whether your goal is to build brand awareness, get more website visits, or increase downloads of your mobile app, Instagram can help you access a huge, engaged audience. Read on for a rundown of photo, video, and carousel ads, and then watch the video below to determine which is the best option for your business.
Instagram photo ads
With photo ads, businesses can tell their story and feature products through visually engaging imagery. Market your brand to a broad audience or just the customers in your hometown with guaranteed impressions.
For example, Brazilian paint brand, Suvinil launched an Instagram ads campaign focused on a specific target audience—people over 35. With the help of Instagram’s segmentation tools, Suvinil targeted people who might be interested in buying their paint. People who announced moving, or had recently changed their relationship status, as well as people who had interests in pregnancy and decor.
In just 2 months, the campaign achieved a 15-point increase in ad recall on Instagram.
Instagram video ads
You can make Instagram video ads up to 60 seconds long, but according to data from Wista, the first 30 seconds of a social video is what matters most. If you can hook your audience in that timeframe, they are more likely to stick around and engage.
Many brands have had great success with Instagram video ads. Creative app company Lightricks used beautiful Instagram videos to help them hit the top of the download charts with their new app Enlight.
The direct-response video ads were a huge hit, boosting Lightricks’ conversion rate by 50 percent compared to non-Instagram campaigns. They achieved enormous reach and a lower cost per install, while racking up 40 million post engagements along the way. In the end, Enlight secured more than 300,000 downloads and hit the number one spot in the global iOS paid app charts.
Instagram carousel ads
With carousel ads, Instagram users can swipe to see additional images and a call to action button takes them to a website to learn more. Carousel ads are like the digital version of the multi-page print campaigns of yesteryear. Unlike print ads, carousel ads offer the added benefit of taking people to a website to learn more.
For example, a new restaurant could showcase how multiple ingredients come together to make a delicious meal. Once their appetite is whet, you can have a button that directs them to the reservations page of your website.
Running race organizer Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series wanted to encourage people to sign up for one of its events, so it created targeted carousel ads on Instagram to promote its one-day sale.
The team first targeted people who had registered for a past event, and then generated a new audience based on those runners’ friends and people who shared their interests. The company ran a teaser video ad in the two days leading up to the single-day Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon sale. The video boosted awareness of the race series and alerted people to the upcoming sale.
The race company then targeted carousel link ads to those people who interacted with the video. The ad featured runners holding signs announcing the lowest prices of the year, while a series of calls to action invited people to sign up.
The Rock ‘n’ Roll team succeeded with its Instagram ad winter sale promo, achieving a 24 time return on ad spend and a 52 percent increase in registrations, year-over-year.
Call-to-action buttons
In late 2015 Instagram added several new features to its advertising platform, including call-to-action buttons such as Shop Now and Install Now. The Call to Action (CTA) button is designed to bring a business’ most important objective to the front lines of its Instagram presence. Call to action buttons link to any destination on or off Instagram that aligns with a business’s goals.

How to advertise on Instagram
To run ads on Instagram you’ll first need a Facebook page. Facebook now owns Instagram and the two platforms work in conjunction. Pages are for brands, organizations, and public figures.
Like Facebook profiles, Pages can be customized with stories, events and more. People who like a Page can get updates in News Feed. Learn more about setting up a Facebook page for your business with Hootsuite’s Facebook Marketing: The Complete Guide. Once you have that process down, you can get started with Instagram ads.
First, sign up for Business Manager
Go to business.facebook.com.
Click Create Account.
Enter a name for your business, select the primary Page, and enter your name and work email address. If you don’t yet have a Page for your business.
Move through the rest of the on-boarding flow by entering the rest of the required fields.
Learn how to add people to Business Manager.
Once you have Business Manager setup, you can add your Instagram account
Go to your Business Manager.
On the left side of the page, click Business Settings then Instagram Accounts.
Click Claim New Instagram Account.
Add your username and password, then click Next.
To authorize one or more of your ad accounts to use the Instagram account, check the box next to each ad account and click Save Changes.
Whoo! That was a lot of steps. Now you are ready to create your Instagram ad.
Go to ad creation.
Choose an objective from the list. Keep in mind that only the following objectives will allow you to create ads that will be eligible to appear on Instagram: Brand awareness, Reach, Traffic (for clicks to your website or to the app store for your app), App installs, Engagement (for post engagement only), Video views, and Conversions (for conversions on your website or app).
Note: Some of these objectives may look different when you create an ad. Learn more about the changes to objectives.
Next to Campaign Name, add a name for your campaign or use the default name that appears.
Now it’s time to choose the audience for your ad.
In the Audience section, create an audience for your ad. You can choose audience characteristics such as age, gender, interests, behaviors, ethnic affinity, location, and even politics. Learn about the targeting options available.
Like Facebook ads, Instagram ads offer options to pay per engagement or by impression (CPM). The average cost per click for an Instagram ad in Q3 2016 was $0.72. If your boss has given you a specific budget for your Instagram ad campaign, you can set it in the Budget and Schedule section, where you can choose a budget and set your ad’s schedule.
You can choose either a daily budget or a lifetime budget for your campaign. Choose wisely.
Daily budget sets your ad up to run continuously throughout the day, meaning that the algorithm will automatically pace your spending per day. With this option there is a minimum daily budget depending on different factors in your campaign.
Lifetime budget gives your ad a run for a specified length of time, meaning the algorithm paces your spending over the entire time period that you set for the campaign.
You can set your optimization and bid options manually. In the Optimize for Ad Delivery section, you’ll update how you want to optimize your ad. In the Bid Amount section, you can choose a manual bid.
Next to Ad Set Name, add a name for your ad set or use the default name that appears.
In the Format section, choose the type of media you’d like your ad to include. Review the technical and design recommendations to make sure your photos and videos are putting their best foot forward.

Below Ad Preview, you’ll see all of the placements your ad will be shown on. By default, all of the placements will be selected. It’s recommended that you run your ads on Facebook and Instagram at the same time. But if you’d like to only show your ads on Instagram, click Remove next to all of the placements except for Instagram.
Once you’ve completed your ad (hooray!), click Place Order in the bottom-right corner. Don’t forget to review your ad closely before hitting the big green button. Since your ads have the potential to be seen by a large audience, you can’t risk a typo or inappropriate joke. If you’d feel better getting a teammate’s eyes on them before they fly out into the world, set your schedule to include a delay, but still place your order.

Instagram ads best practices
Know your audience
One of the most wonderful features of Instagram ads is the targeting capabilities. Rather than sending a photo of your business out into the ether, you can send it directly to people who might already be interested in what you have to offer.
Who might those customers be? Our handy guide to creating audience personas outlines the questions you need to ask yourself to determine who your customers are. How old are they? Where do they live? What sorts of jobs do they have? What do they do outside of work?
Check out the video below to learn more about targeting and optimizing your Instagram ads.

Captivate with captions
Images aren’t everything. The caption on your Instagram post provides an excellent opportunity to show off your brand’s personality. Your brand voice is part of you broader social media marketing plan. Start by asking yourself: what are the qualities and values I want my brand to promote? Make a list and use it to shape your image. You might also try brainstorming a few adjectives that describe your brand and use those to refine the voice.
For more, check out our guide to writing great Instagram captions.
Use hashtags
Instagram posts with at least one hashtag average 12.6 percent more engagement than those with no hashtags, according to a study by Simply Measured. So use them when they are relevant to your post and target audience—but don’t use so many that they crowd your copy and make it difficult to read. Learn more about hashtagging like a pro in The Complete Instagram Hashtag Guide for Business.
Be consistent
Using the same filter or style on your brand’s Instagram posts can give your feed a consistent look. Your audience will recognize you right away in their feed. Researchers found that 90 percent of immediate judgments made about a product can be based on color alone. Not only that but “the relationship between brands and color hinges on the perceived appropriateness of the color being used for the particular brand.”

This was a difficult shitlist to compile because 2016 produced a shitpile of shitty ads; the biggest, shittiest ad shitpile ever. Imagine a Tower of Babel made of shit, filled with a shit-ton of shit-talking marketing shitheads senselessly shouting out every window about their shit-awful ads, non-stop. That was The Year in Advertising, 2016.
Therefore, this just needed to be done. And here they are: The bottom 1o ads of 2016, from least worst to worst worst.
Advertisement
10. Am/Pm Organic Cafe, Nepal, “Flowchart”
I could go into the logic of this headache of a flowchart billboard (note that if you have a problem and can’t do anything about it, there is a line up to their logo, but no arrow), but I’d rather just take a 50 cal Gatling gun to it. Found on reddit.
9. Apartments.com, “Apartments Alert”
VIDEO
Remember Max Headroom? I liked him (although he was mistakenly used to try to save New Coke), and his name was creative. Brad Bellflower is not creative or funny or interesting or relevant or useful. I just want to punch his face through the back of his skull. Agency: RPA.
8. Ignite Instant Light Charcoal, “Fly”
From agency DDB South Africa’s press note: “Ignite…catches alight so fast that an insect sitting on one of the coals would be incinerated before it could fly away.” (This is a lie.)
How about 25 insects? And would my steak then have an aftertaste of burnt fly? Why not put a couple of cockroaches in the ad, too? Maybe a dung beetle.
7. American Express, “Tina Fey’s Guide To Workout Gear”
VIDEO
Maybe the most embarrassingly unfunny commercial of 2016. I hope Fey didn’t help with the writing. But the script isn’t what got this spot in the bottom 10. It’s how much shit she bought, how obnoxiously Amex shoves hyper-consumerism into our less-rich-than-Fey faces. Buy! Buy! BUY!
6. Mellow Mushroom Pizza Bakers, “Clinically Proven”
VIDEO
Parodying Erectile Dysfunction ads (badly) to sell pizza is a brilliant move, said nobody with or without penis, ever. Agency: BooneOakley, Charlotte.
5. Secret, “Raise”
VIDEO
“Feminine” brands pandering to millennial women mean well, buy they mostly don’t execute well. And this very uncomfortable spot portrays our hero as, well, a very stupid person. Here’s a more in-depth take on why the ad sucks from a smart millennial woman. Note: this whole Pandering Awkwardly To Young Women Femvertising Movement is Dove’s fault.
4. and 3. (tie) Pizza Hut “#PizzaBump” and Bergedorfer Beer, “Pregnant”
VIDEO
The spot, via Grip Limited, Toronto, is for Pizza Hut’s “Triple Treat Box.” And, see, these men have eaten so many pizzas that they got so fat that they look pregnant, but are not, but are probably close to death.
These ads, by Jung von Matt, Hamburg, are for Bergedorfer Beer. And, see, these alcoholics have drunk so much of the beer that they have massive beer guts that make them look pregnant. They are also close to death. And not pregnant.
The “pregnant male” is such a refreshing, original, game-changing, crackerjack of a creative linchpin, isn’t it?
2. Facebook “station takeover”
Image via: Instagram.
Facebook did this “takeover” execution in a few stations worldwide. Nothing dehumanizingly dystopian about this experience. Also, it’s not at all a scary metaphor for Facebook’s ultimate goal of taking over your life 100 percent, 24/7. The next step in this campaign is, you will see your own Facebook page updates on the walls/ceilings around you in every subway/train station in the world.
1. Chevy, “Stereotypes”
VIDEO
This list, of course, should be made up of 10 of these Chevy “Real People, Not Actors” ads. I just picked the worst one. (The “breakdancing millennials” spot they mock here would be a much better ad than this commercial.) I don’t care how many Chevrolets this campaign is selling, because it continues to make the world a markedly worse place.
And, it needs to be said, more than a few of the real people in these ads are actors. According to GM, they just don’t have their SAG cards yet. (I don’t believe that either.) But that’s not what makes the spots the shittiest ads of 2016. It’s the cringeworthy dialogue between the coached “people” and the astoundingly annoying and pathetically smarmy host, an actor named Potsch Boyd. Agency: Commonwealth/McCann, Detroit.
